# metaschema-node

Node.js tools and libraries providing a Metaschema toolchain.

## Description

`metaschema-node` is an open-source framework that offers a set of Node.js libraries providing a programmatic way to work with models defined by the [Metaschema modeling language](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema).
This framework also facilitates the programmatic creation, modification, parsing, and writing of XML, JSON, and YAML instance data that conforms to a given Metaschema model.
This work is intended to make it easier for Node.js developers to incorporate Metaschema-based capabilities into their applications.

This effort is part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) Program.

`metaschema-node` provides:

-   Typescript classes for loading and working with XML-based Metaschema constructs. **(IN PROGRESS)**
-   Typescript code generation based on one or more Metaschemas **(TODO)**
-   A Typescript implementation of Metapath used to implement Metaschema's constraint validation system **(TODO)**
-   A Typescript parser for reading and writing XML, JSON, or YAML into Typescript classes generated by this framework **(TODO)**
