# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-05-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

We also need the ability to compare the design decisions made between the major "canonical" Metaschema implementations.

This decision has been inherited from https://github.com/usnistgov/nmetaschema/blob/main/docs/decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in his article ["Documenting Architecture Decisions"](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
